Systems where there are devices with different capabilities and separate memory regions, are called distributed systems.
Devices in such systems may only communicate via message passing, since memory is not shared.
Conversely, if there is a set of devices with non shared memory, they form a distributed system.

For example:
1. GPUs and CPUs
2. Computers on a network
3. Isolated components
