Informally means "any value of type A can be used as a value of type B", when A is subtype of B.

Subtyping defines relation `<:` over types, such that if `a <: b`, then `a` is subtype of `b`.

Useful property:
1. Subject reduction. Since now multiple types can be assigned to a single term, and type of a parameter may not be exactly the expected one.
