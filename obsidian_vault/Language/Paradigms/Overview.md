We can classify paradigms into:

1. Declarative - reactive, dataflow, logic, constraint, rule, functional, pipeline, template, modular. Primarily define *what* the program is, not *how* it is evaluated.
2. Imperative - procedural, object-oriented, structured, scripting. The opposite of declarative. Primarily define *how* the program is evaluated and what exactly it does.

More granular classification can be based on a paradigm's core domain of application:
1. Communication paradigms - distributed, shared, parallel, reactive, relativistic, dataflow, actors, persistent, transactional. Considers how multiple machines, processes, threads, streams, etc. interact with each other.
2. Behavioral paradigms - functional, procedural, low level, structured, concurrent, dataflow, pipeline, tacit, logic, continuation, constraint, differentiable, rule, invariant. Considers how a program behavior is defined and executed.
3. Structural paradigms - object-oriented, modular, component-oriented, scripting, aspect-oriented, data-oriented. Considers how a program is organized from smaller to bigger pieces.
4. Meta paradigms - type programming, attribute-oriented, automatic, extensible, reflective, symbolic, template. Considers how a program can manipulate itself or parts of it.
