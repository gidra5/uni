Characteristics of interest for any type theory\lambda calculus:
1. Normalization - does all terms reduce to some irreducible normal form? Does reduction terminate for all terms? Does normal form depend on the choice of reductions, is normal form unique?
2. Soundness - is it possible to receive argument that is not a member of expected type?
3. Equality of terms - is it possible to decide if two terms are equal?
4. Consistency - is it possible to provide term of an empty type (void)?
5. If term `a` reduces to term `b`, do they inhabit the same type?
6. is reduction an equivalence relation
7. Subject reduction - reduction of a term preserves its type.
